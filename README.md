## What You'll Need

:small_blue_diamond: Snowflake

:small_blue_diamond: A Snowflake Account.

:small_blue_diamond: A Snowflake User created with appropriate permissions. This user will need permission to create databases.

:small_blue_diamond: GitHub

:small_blue_diamond: A GitHub Account. If you don't already have a GitHub account you can create one for free. Visit the Join GitHub page to get started.

:small_blue_diamond: A GitHub Repository. If you don't already have a repository created, or would like to create a new one, then Create a new respository. For the type, select Public (although you could use either). And you can skip adding the README, .gitignore and license for now.

:small_blue_diamond: Terraform Cloud

:small_blue_diamond: A Terraform Cloud Account. If you don't already have a Terraform Cloud account you can create on for free. Visit the Create an account page to get started.

:small_blue_diamond: Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

:small_blue_diamond:Your favorite IDE with Git integration. If you don't already have a favorite IDE that integrates with Git I would recommend the great, free, open-source Visual Studio Code.
Your project repository cloned to your computer. For connection details about your Git repository, open the Repository and copy the HTTPS link provided near the top of the page. If you have at least one file in your repository then click on the green Code icon near the top of the page and copy the HTTPS link. Use that link in VS Code or your favorite IDE to clone the repo to your computer.
